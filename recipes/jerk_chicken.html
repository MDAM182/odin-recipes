    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      These jerk chicken wings are so flavorful, different, and delicious that I
      may have eaten my last Buffalo wing. Okay, I didn't mean that, but these
      are amazing and have the perfect balance of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy.
      I'm usually pretty casual about you changing my recipes, but I insist you
      not change any of the key ingredients, which are every one of them.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ yellow onion, chopped</li>
      <li>3 habanero peppers, seeded and chopped</li>

      <li>½ cup green onions, sliced</li>
      <li>⅓ cup lime juice</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground allspice</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
      <li>3 pounds chicken wing drumettes</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place yellow onion, habanero peppers, green onions, lime juice, soy
        sauce, garlic, fresh thyme, brown sugar, oil, salt, black pepper,
        allspice, dried thyme, cinnamon, cumin, and nutmeg into a blender. Blend
        until marinade is completely smooth.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place chicken drumettes into a large bowl. Pour marinade over chicken
        and toss to coat completely. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
        marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with aluminum foil and coat with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Arrange chicken evenly on the prepared baking sheet; reserve marinade in
        the bowl.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Brush 1/2 of the reserved
        marinade onto chicken, then turn over. Bake for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Turn chicken over and brush with remaining reserved marinade. Continue
        baking until tender and caramelized, 10 to 15 more minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read at least 165
        degrees F (74 degrees C). Rest chicken on the baking sheet for 5 minutes
        before removing to a serving platter.
